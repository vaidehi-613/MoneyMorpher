# MoneyMorpher (Currency convertor Chatbot )

A currency conversion chatbot is built using Dialogflow, Flask frameworks, and Ngrok for secure tunneling, and and the Currency Converter API. The chatbot is capable of converting various currencies with real-time exchange rates and providing instant results to the user.

I used Dialogflow to build the chatbot's natural language processing capabilities, allowing it to understand and interpret user inputs in a conversational manner. Flask was used to build the backend of the chatbot, providing a simple and efficient way to handle user requests and currency conversion operations.

To ensure secure communication between the chatbot and users, I implemented Ngrok to create a secure tunnel that allows encrypted traffic to flow through it. This provides a secure communication channel for the chatbot and users to exchange sensitive information such as currency conversion rates and financial transactions.

The Currency Converter API ( https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/ )was used to fetch real-time exchange rates for various currencies, ensuring accurate currency conversion calculations. This API provided a reliable and efficient way to fetch real-time exchange rates, enabling the chatbot to provide accurate and up-to-date currency conversion results to users.

# Dialogflow ( https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/ )
Dialogflow is a natural language processing (NLP) platform developed by Google, used for building conversational chatbots and virtual agents. It allows developers to create intelligent chatbots that can understand and interpret user inputs in a conversational manner.

Dialogflow provides a range of tools and features to build conversational experiences, such as text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities, intent recognition, entity extraction, and context management. These tools enable developers to create conversational chatbots that can understand the user's intent and provide relevant responses.

Dialogflow supports integration with various messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, and WhatsApp, as well as voice assistants such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Microsoft Cortana.

# Ngrok ( https://ngrok.com/ )
Ngrok is a tool used for secure tunneling, which creates a secure communication channel between a public network (such as the internet) and a private network (such as a local computer or server). It allows developers to expose their local web server to the internet for testing, demoing or sharing the website/application.

Ngrok provides a temporary public URL that allows external clients to access the web server running on the developer's local machine or server. This is useful in scenarios where a developer wants to share a local website or application with a client or team member for testing, or wants to access a local website or application from a remote location.
